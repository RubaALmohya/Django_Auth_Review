# Django_Auth_Review

Previously, we create an eCommerce website. Now, we will add more functionalities to the website as the following.

## First: User Authentication

These steps will help you complete your task:

- Create Accounts App
- Create a templates folder with three HTML pages(login, register, and dashboard).
- Create urls.py that has a login, register, logout, and dashboard paths.

- Add the login link to the navigation bar

- Add login and register bootstrap 

hint: for login use: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/


- Display an error message if the passwords do not match.
- Display an error message if the user name is taken.
- Display an error message if the email is being used.
- Display a success message if registration is successfully done.
